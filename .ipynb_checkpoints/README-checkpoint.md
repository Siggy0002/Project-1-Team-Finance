Project Description/Outline:

In the “Customer Purchases Behaviour” project we will explore, clean, process, analyze, and present a summary of the dataset that contains 100 000 examples of customer purchases. The dataset was simulated, but mimics real-world scenarios. The findings of the project would benefit various businesses to better understand and cater to the needs of their target audience.
