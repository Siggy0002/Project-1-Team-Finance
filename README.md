Project Description/Outline:

In the “Customer Purchases Behaviour” project we will explore, clean, process, analyze, and present a summary of the dataset that contains 100 000 examples of customer purchases. The dataset was simulated, but mimics real-world scenarios. The findings of the project would benefit various businesses to better understand and cater to the needs of their target audience. 
****
Datasets to be Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanyamgoyal401/customer-purchases-behaviour-dataset/data

***
Research Questions to Answer:
1. Do loyalty programs affect how frequently the customers shop? 
2. Does the age of a customer affect how often they shop?
3. How does promotion usage relate to purchase frequency?
4. In what region do people spend the most?
5. Is there any correlation between customer income and purchase amount?

****
How to run code:

To run the code open up the 'Project 1 code.ipynb' then run all cells.
It will start with exploring the data by breaking down the various data types.
Then it will go into each question and explore the specific data relating to the question.

****

Format:
Data Exploration

Question:  
    Hypothesis and what question is being answered

    Code breaking down what data will be analyized 

    visulization of the data 

    Analysis

This format repeats for each question 

All visulizations will be saved to the resource folder.

****

Resource Folder:
Inside the resource folder is the data that is being analyzed along with all graphs and other visualizations that are made.
There is also the starter code that the group used to start the analysis.


Code by person:
Inside this folder is the code that each person used broken down separately
